            <p>"Best for being himself" - Hanad. S<br>I'm a recently turn seventeen year old boy that needs to be smarted and loss weight.<br>
            The first, I like to play sprots, any kind of sports; Soocer, Football, Baseball, Basketball, Volleyball. The only sport I dind't play were Hockey, Cricket, Rugby, and every other sports.<br>
            What I like are Actions pack story/games, any kind of Mystery, and Humor. I have watch shows in my tv, most were <a>Cartoon network</a>. My favorite show was to watch was Gravity Falls and Regular show.<br>
            I soon couldn't watch the tv shows because my mom stop paying and only paid for Netflix. Soon then I watch lots of Youtube then and now, but mostly I began watching Anime.<br>
            I only watch Anime and not the other NFSW Anime, because I was still a child like fourteen years old. But I soon like it for it was better than some of the Cartoon network or PBS kids show.<br>
            Naruto shippeden, Bleach, Dragonball z, Deomon slayer, Overlord, Fairy Tale, and Hunter X Hunter were my favorite Anime to watch in the top of my head. The reseaon why they were fun to watch where they all had hilarouis jokes/moment, sad/emotional event, and action to them. I actual care for the characters in the show felt exited or angry.<br>
            The other two show like Regular show and Gravity Fall, first Regular show was confusing at first but than to progressively the action and had short emotion, but lots of action and confusion. Gravity Falls was fun to solve the mystery and understand wht the author is trying to tell us. I mostly watch videos of solving mystrey of Gravity falls inorder to understand.<br>
            I'm a all around queit and loud person, I don't talk a lot, but I do mainly convert communications with other humans time to time. I have a family of three, My mom, little brother, and Me. I own a cat that isn't mine but a neighbor cats ask if "STUD" can stay with you for a week. I said no, but my mom agree to it and now the woman is long gone and this cat doesn't even responed to his OWN NAME.<br>
            I longly after call him Kevin instead, he likes to stuff his face with food and rub his face everywhere even on my head and everyone in the house head.<br>
            I go to a highschool call Deer valley highschool and West-mec Northeast.</p>
